# Kent Panopto recordings downloader

The idea is to take an RSS feed of Panopto recordings from the University of Kent and download them to `~/Movies/Kent-Recordings/%feed name%`

Seems to work, to use it simply clone the repository then run:

```
go run main.go https://whateverthereallylongrssfeedurlis
```
